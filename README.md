# Getting started

This project doesn't include state management part itself, because the same state management is also used from web version of this app ([https://github.com/GarikHarutyunyan/react-sudoku/](https://github.com/GarikHarutyunyan/react-sudoku)).

You need to clone redux-sudoku repository to coresponding directory to be able to use it.

```bash
cd src
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GarikHarutyunyan/redux-sudoku.git
```
